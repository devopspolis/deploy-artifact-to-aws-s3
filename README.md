## üì¶ Example Usage

### Basic Usage - Extract and Upload ZIP Contents

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Upload website
        uses: devopspolis/deploy-artifact-to-aws-s3@main
        with:
          artifact: build-output
          path: website.zip
          bucket: my-website-bucket
          aws-region: us-west-2
```

### Upload to S3 with Prefix

```yaml
- name: Deploy to staging
  uses: devopspolis/deploy-artifact-to-aws-s3@main
  with:
    artifact: build-output
    path: dist.zip
    bucket: my-bucket/staging/v1.2.0/
    aws-region: us-east-1
    tags: environment=staging,version=v1.2.0
```

### Upload Raw Archive Without Extraction

```yaml
- name: Upload backup archive
  uses: devopspolis/deploy-artifact-to-aws-s3@main
  with:
    artifact: backup
    path: backup.tar.gz
    bucket: backup-bucket
    extract-artifact: false
    delete: false
```

### Advanced Usage with Pre-upload Script

```yaml
- name: Deploy with processing
  uses: devopspolis/deploy-artifact-to-aws-s3@main
  with:
    artifact: app-build
    path: app-build.zip
    bucket: production-bucket/releases/
    script: ./scripts/prepare-deploy.sh
    working-directory: .
    aws-region: us-west-2
    tags: environment=production,deployed-by=github-actions
```

### Using IAM Role Assumption

```yaml
- name: Deploy with assumed role
  uses: devopspolis/deploy-artifact-to-aws-s3@main
  with:
    artifact: webapp
    path: webapp.zip
    bucket: secure-bucket
    role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DeploymentRole
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

### Using Short Role Name

```yaml
- name: Deploy with short role name
  uses: devopspolis/deploy-artifact-to-aws-s3@main
  with:
    artifact: webapp
    path: webapp.zip
    bucket: secure-bucket
    role: DeploymentRole  # Will be expanded to full ARN
  env:
    AWS_ACCOUNT_ID: 123456789012  # Required for short role names
    AWS_REGION: us-east-1
```

---

## üîß Supported Archive Formats

The action automatically detects archive formats based on file extensions:

- **ZIP**: `.zip`
- **TAR**: `.tar`
- **TAR.GZ**: `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`

When `extract-artifact` is `true` (default), the action will extract the archive and upload its contents. When `false`, the archive file is uploaded as-is.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è S3 Bucket Tagging

You can apply tags to your S3 bucket using the `tags` input:

```yaml
tags: environment=production,version=v1.2.0,team=frontend
```

Tags should be formatted as comma-separated key=value pairs.

---

## üîí IAM Permissions

Your AWS credentials or IAM role must have the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:PutBucketTagging"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Unsupported file format**: Ensure your artifact uses supported extensions (`.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`)
2. **Script not executable**: Make sure your pre-upload script has execute permissions
3. **Missing AWS credentials**: Verify AWS credentials are configured or IAM role is properly assumed
4. **Short role name failure**: When using short role names, ensure `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable is set

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository settings.
